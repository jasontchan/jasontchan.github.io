Partnering with non-profit LA Waterkeeper, our team created an interactive web app to help educate the public about the LA River's history, importance, and future. The app includes an interactive map that shows active project areas along the river and highlights key project areas. Along with the interactive map, we added a key focus area on the website known as the “7 Wins,” which includes biodiversity, water supply, habitat restoration, water quality, climate resilience, public access, and cultural heritage. Through an engaging, user-friendly design, the app empowers users to learn more about the river’s role in the local ecosystem and how ongoing efforts are shaping a healthier, more sustainable Los Angeles.
